# shiki-repro
 
For whatever reason highlighting of Svelte code has broken in Safari. This seems to be as the result of a Safari update as Shiki hasn't been updated.

In the Safari console you will see the following error:

```
Unhandled Promise Rejection: SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: invalid operation in class set
```
